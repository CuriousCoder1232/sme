Welcome to the home of **Super Mario Eclipse's** source code and assets! This is where you can reference things for your own mod, or even build the project yourself!

If you simply want to view the source code for referential or curious purposes, you can find it in `src/`

## Requirements

- Build [Kuribo-Clang](https://github.com/DotKuribo/llvm-project) and move the files into `assets/bin/compiler/clang/`
- Supply the DOL file for SMS of any supported region into `assets/bin/<build>/<region>/system/`

## Compile

Building this mod is as simple as configuring the build scripts to use your extracted root for patching and then running these build scripts as you need. **Release**, **Release-Debug**, and **Debug** configurations are provided.

## Credits

Any and all uses of this repository's source code should credit both **JoshuaMK** (myself), and **CyrusLoS**, and use of the source assets should credit the **SME Dev Team**.
